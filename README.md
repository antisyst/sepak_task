# Financial Dashboard Application ( Ramazan Azimli )

This is a financial dashboard application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to search for stock symbols, fetch stock data, and display stock charts.

## Instructions Part

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the application.

## Considerations

- This project uses TypeScript for static type-checking, providing better code quality and developer experience.
- The application fetches stock data from the IEX Cloud API using Axios for making HTTP requests.
- It includes components such as StockSearch, StockChart, StockInfo, and StockService for managing stock-related functionality.

## Design Part

- The design of the project is simple yet user-friendly. And the design is fully responsive. While I spent little time on the design, I think the interface is pretty cool.


## Estimated Time

In the description of the assignment you sent, you emphasized that the project should not take a lot of time, only a few hours to complete. It took me about 2 hours or less to finish the project. If you give me some time, I could take the project to more high level
